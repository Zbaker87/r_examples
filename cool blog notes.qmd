## HW: for tuesday 1/30/24

1.  Take notes in a quarto file about R codeing
2.  Use R graph gallery to find base r graph code
3.  save code to quarto file not R document
4.  Make a quarto document about the process you did to change the graph in the quarto document \## make histogram in R

## Notes from: R Blogger- The most common R error messages

-   error obscurity can be broken down by categorization
-   errors from package installation to eval can be solved through re presenting the data

## Making a graph:

```{r}
# Create data
x <- seq(1,29)^2+runif(29,0.98)
y <- abs(seq(1,29)+4*runif(29,0.4))

# Make the plotwith ylim in reverse
plot(y~x , ylim = rev(range(y)) ,
     lwd=4 , type="l" , bty="n" , ylab="Mental Health" , xlab="Time Spent in Graduate School (Months)", col=rgb(0.2,0.7,0.4,0.9) )

#Add the grey lines
abline(v=seq(0,900,100) , col="grey" , lwd=0.6)
```
